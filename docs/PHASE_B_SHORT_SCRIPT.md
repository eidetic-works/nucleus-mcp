# Phase B: Engram Recall (Short-Form Script)
**Duration:** 45 Seconds  
**Goal:** Demonstrate agents remembering past decisions across sessions.

---

### Visual
- Opening a fresh terminal / fresh conversation.
- Querying a decision made months ago (e.g., "Why did we choose Postgres for the billing service?").
- Nucleus retrieving the engram from the ledger seamlessly.

### Script
> "This is Phase B: Engram Recall."
>
> "Your agents shouldn't have amnesia. Every decision made in Nucleus is etched into the Engram Ledger."
>
> "This specific decision was written four months ago. New thread, new IDE, new model—it doesn't matter. The context persists because governance is baked into the infrastructure, not the prompt."
>
> "Stop repeating yourself. Build agents that actually learn, governed by the ground truth of your engram history."

### ACTION
1. Query a historical engram in a fresh session.
