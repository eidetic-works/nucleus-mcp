# Nucleus v0.5: The Netscape Event (Master Demo Script)
**For:** Official v0.5 Launch Video  
**Duration:** 3:30  
**Narrator:** Warm, technical, focused (Antoni/Neural2-J)

## SCENE 1: The Fragmentation (0:00 - 0:45)

### Visual
- Cluttered Claude Desktop MCP config file (JSON).
- Close-up of 20+ separate server configurations.
- Abstract animation: Fragmented silos of data/tools.

### Script
> "The Agentic Web is fragmented. Every new tool is another silo. Every new agent is a new configuration debt. This is the bottleneck of linear growth."
>
> "But what if your agent had a browser? Not just a tool, but a navigable mesh."
>
> "This is Nucleus v0.5: The Netscape moment for the Internet of Agents."

---

## SCENE 2: The Thanos Snap (0:45 - 1:30)

### Visual
- Terminal showing `nucleus mount add`.
- Real-time tool discovery in Claude.
- Visualizing the "Recursive Mount": Mounting a Parent Nucleus that already has 5 Children.

### Script
> "We call this the Thanos Snap. Instead of connecting 50 tools to your agent, you connect them to Nucleus. And then, you mount Nucleus."
>
> "With Recursive Mounting, one connection provides a unified namespace for your entire tool mesh. It’s fractal connectivity. Mount one, inherit all."

---

## SCENE 3: The Unified Namespace (1:30 - 2:15)

### Visual
- Claude calling `fs:read_file`.
- Claude calling `git:commit`.
- Showing how `mount_id:tool_name` creates a governed, navigable structure.

### Script
> "Namespacing is the key to scale. Tools are no longer a flat list of chaos. They are a organized, prefix-driven web. `fs` for files, `mem` for engrams, `stripe` for transactions. Total clarity for the agent. Total control for you."

---

## SCENE 4: The Verisign Pillar (2:15 - 3:00)

### Visual
- An agent tries to delete a sensitive file.
- Nucleus blocks the action (Default-Deny).
- Terminal shows: `Generating Cryptographic Receipt...`
- Highlight the SHA-256 signed audit log.

### Script
> "In the age of autonomous agents, trust is the only currency. This is the Verisign Pillar. Nucleus doesn’t just route actions; it certifies them."
>
> "Every decision generates a cryptographic receipt. A permanent 'Why-Trace' that proves the chain of custody. Governance isn't a prompt. It’s infrastructure."

---

## SCENE 5: The Poison Pill (3:00 - 3:30)

### Visual
- Morphing from code to the Landing Page (nucleusos.dev).
- Call to action: `pip install nucleus-mcp`.
- GitHub Repo with a "Star" button being clicked.

### Script
> "Stop building silos. Start building the mesh. Nucleus is free, local-first, and open source. The browser for agents is here."
>
> "pip install nucleus-mcp. Join the standard."
