## Key Changes for Open Source Version

The original demo video is **perfect for the open source launch**. No changes needed because:

1. ✅ Shows the core value prop (persistent memory)
2. ✅ Shows pip install (same command)
3. ✅ Shows Claude Desktop integration
4. ✅ Mentions "Open source. MIT licensed."
5. ✅ Shows real tool usage (brain_get_state, artifacts)

**The video can be used as-is.**
