[Switch to Cursor, type:]
"What database are we using for the user service?"

## Recording Tips

1. **Resolution**: 1920x1080 minimum
2. **Font size**: Increase terminal/editor font to 16-18pt
3. **Speed**: Move deliberately, not too fast
4. **Clean desktop**: Hide notifications, dock if possible
5. **Audio**: Optional - can be silent GIF with captions

## Post-Production

1. Add subtle background music (optional, royalty-free)
2. Add text overlays as scripted
3. Export as:
   - MP4 for YouTube/Twitter
   - GIF for README (compress to <5MB)
   - WebM for web embedding

## File Naming
- `nucleus_demo_60s.mp4`
- `nucleus_demo_readme.gif`
