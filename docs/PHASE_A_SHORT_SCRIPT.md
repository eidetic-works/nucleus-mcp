# Phase A: Sovereign Context (Short-Form Script)
**Duration:** 45 Seconds  
**Goal:** Showcase Nucleus blocking a malicious/accidental deletion.

---

### Visual
- Terminal showing an agent trying to `rm .env` or modify a protected key.
- Nucleus intercepting: "🚫 BLOCKED: sovereign_lock active."
- Generation of a cryptographic audit receipt.

### Script
> "This is Phase A: Sovereign Context."
>
> "You're watching an agent try to modify your environment credentials. Nucleus intercepts the system call, blocks the modification, and issues a cryptographic receipt."
>
> "This isn't just a guardrail; it's sovereign control. In an agent-first economy, trust must be built into the infrastructure, not the prompt."
>
> "With Nucleus v0.5, your context is locked. Zero-trust is no longer an option—it's the default."

### ACTION
1. Run a mock audit demo (e.g., `nucleus_delete_file` on a locked resource).
2. Record the blocking event and the ledger entry.
3. Sync with the ElevenLabs audio for "Demo A".
