# Thread Registry

> **Protocol:** Agents check this file on activation to know their role.
> **Stable Anchor:** Thread ID (UUID) never changes, even when IDE renames the thread.

## Active Threads

| Thread ID | Role | Focus |
|:----------|:-----|:------|
| *(Add your threads here)* | | |

## How to Use

1. **Find your thread ID** in your IDE's artifact path (e.g., `.gemini/antigravity/brain/<thread-id>/`)
2. **Add a row** to the table above with your role
3. **Agent self-identifies** on next activation by reading this registry
