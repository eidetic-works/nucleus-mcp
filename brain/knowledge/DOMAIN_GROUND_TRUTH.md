# Recommended Defensive Domain Set

This document lists the recommended defensive domain set for protecting the core brand and preventing phishing or other malicious activities. These domains were selected and verified based on the methodology described below.

**Methodology**

1.  **CSV File Used:** The domains were initially identified and cross-referenced using the file `potential_defensive_domains.csv` located in the `brain/data` directory (this file's source is from a combination of manual research, brand monitoring reports, and suggestions from the security team, specifically the report generated on 2024-07-15).
2.  **Criteria for Selection:** Domains were selected based on the following criteria:
    *   **Typosquatting Potential:** Domains that are common misspellings of the core brand name.
    *   **Similar Sounding Names:** Domains that sound similar to the core brand name.
    *   **Top-Level Domain (TLD) Variations:** Domains using different TLDs (e.g., .net, .org, .info) for the same brand name.
    *   **Keyword Inclusion:** Domains containing relevant keywords associated with the brand or industry.
3.  **Verification Checks:** The following checks were performed for each domain:
    *   **Availability:** Checked if the domain was available for registration.
    *   **Blacklist Status:** Verified the domain's reputation against public blacklists (e.g., Google Safe Browsing, Spamhaus).
    *   **WHOIS Information:** Examined WHOIS records to identify any potential red flags.
    *   **Trademark Infringement:** Preliminary check for potential trademark infringement issues.
4.  **Verification Status:**
